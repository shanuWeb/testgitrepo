                        <h4><strong>What warranty do I have?</strong></h4>
                        <p>With all hardware, YOYOTech offers a standard 12 month warranty in accordance with the Sale of Goods Act 1979. In the rare cases when a product does develop an issue, we will work with you to get a repair or replacement as quickly as possible.<br><br></p>
                        <h4><strong>Which payment is best?</strong></h4>
                        <p>YOYOTech accepts a wide variety of Debit and Credit Cards..<br><br></p>
                        <h4><strong>How much is delivery?</strong></h4>
                        <p>This information is available at check out once the purchase is determined. Longer distances will cost more, but we will always use the most economic safe method possible.<br><br></p>
                        <h4><strong>How is the PC packaged?</strong></h4>
                        <p>Systems are shipped in a cardboard box that is perfectly suited to shipment around the UK. Inside, we will use packaging materials to ensure a smooth ride for your new computer. Remember, our business is built on you being happy with the system you buy – so we work very hard to make sure you’re happy<br><br></p>
                        <h4><strong>Will I void my warranty if I open the chassis to install new components?</strong></h4>
                        <p>Our PCs are custom built – so they are designed to be upgradeable. However, anytime you open an electrical device, you are introducing an element of risk – especially if you do not have the right training and experience. If you want an upgrade, then the safest thing would be to buy the upgrade component from YOYOTech and we will fit it for you, properly<br><br></p>
                        <h4><strong>Can I get a better price on the system I want?</strong></h4>
                        <p>Good question! The truth is that ‘it varies’. When component prices are on the increase, there is no possibility that we can discount. However, if you’re lucky and prices are moving down – then please use our Live Chat feature to talk to our sales team if you have price compare or any product advice.<br><br></p>
                        <h4><strong>Your prices are low, are your components high quality?</strong></h4>
                        <p>YOYOTech’s reputation in the industry is very strong – and we have won ‘PC Retailer of the Year’ twice. One of the key reasons for this success is that we only use high-quality components that have passed our rigorous testing procedures. We keep our prices low through intelligent purchasing and the fact that we buy so much technology that we get better pricing.</p>
