                        <p><strong>General Troubleshooting Support</strong></p>
                        <p>Our aim is to guide you quickly and identify any potential fault with your PC and/or any components.</p>
                        <p>You may call our Tech Support Team on <a href="tel:01256 378098">01256 378098</a></p>
                        <p>Below are most common symptoms you can try.<br><br></p>
                        <h4><strong>PC not switching on?</strong></h4>
                        <p>First, make sure the power cable is plugged into the wall socket and is switched on.<br>If possible swap the power for the one you know that works, if you have one.<br>Make sure the PSU on/off switched to the on position.<br>If everything appears to be in order and the PSU is functioning as expected, we now need to look at the motherboard which<br>may not be distributing the power correctly.<br><br></p>
                        <h4><strong>Motherboard LED light</strong></h4>
                        <p>Most modern motherboards have an LED which indicates that power is reaching the motherboard. If this is off, then it's a<br>good indication that no power is being received rather than inadequate power.<br><br></p>
                        <h4><strong>If this is a new build, did you fit the motherboard onto motherboard risers?</strong></h4>
                        <p>Risers are supplied with new cases prevent contact with metallic surfaces in the case, preventing a short.<br>If you have screwed the motherboard directly onto the case, you could have damaged the motherboard.</p>
                        <p>If the motherboard LED light is on, we can assume sufficient power is being supplied to the motherboard.<br>Make sure you have both the 24-pin ATX and 4pin/8pin supplementary power supplies securely connected to the<br>motherboard, reseat if necessary.<br><br>Check that the front panel “Power On” cable is connected to the correct headers on the motherboard.<br>Everything appears ok with the connections and the PSU, then it’s looking like a faulty motherboard.<br><br></p>
                        <h4><strong>PC starts but there is no Display?</strong></h4>
                        <p>Check the graphics card is seated correctly in the correct slot and does the graphics card need power if so is it connected?.<br>Most modern cards require one or more 6/8pin PCI-e power connections to make sure the graphics card has sufficient power.<br>If it has sockets for two power connectors, both must be plugged in.<br><br></p>
                        <h4><strong>Are you using the correct graphics port socket?</strong></h4>
                        <p>some motherboards have onboard graphics and are disabled if you are using a dedicated graphics card, make sure you are<br>using the correct port<br><br>If you can, check your system on another monitor and check the monitor cable too.<br><br></p>
                        <h4><strong>If you are replacing a graphics card, have you uninstalled the old drivers?</strong></h4>
                        <p>First, remove old drivers from your PC then install the new graphics card<br>Make sure you are using the latest drivers from the manufacturer’s website at all times.<br>Drivers supplied with graphics tend not to be the latest or up to date.<br>If you can swap the card back to the older card to see if this still works or swap for another known working one. If the problem<br>is illuminated, then it looks certain to be a problem with the video card<br><br></p>
                        <h4><strong>Experiencing graphics problems with the certain game?</strong></h4>
                        <p>It might be worth checking for driver updates and game patches.<br>Make sure you use the latest drivers. If they don’t work, both Nvidia and AMD have archived drivers so try an older driver to see if it makes any difference.<br>If the problem only started since you changed the drivers, then it might be a good idea to either roll back the driver or re-install back the previous known working ones.</p>
                        <p>Please note - unless you have a problem, avoid updating drivers on release. Keep an eye on the feedback for known problems before installing and try to avoid using beta drivers.<br><br></p>
                        <h4><strong>Memory Troubleshooting</strong></h4>
                        <p>Check the RAM is properly seated and is making good contact with the RAM slots if need to reseat the memory again.<br>Important settings for RAM is as follows:<br>Memory Frequency – The speed of which your RAM operates at in MHz.<br>Latency or timings – The Latency is the timing for the RAM to respond between cycles.<br>VDIM or Voltage – The voltage is essential for correct operation but make sure you apply the correct amount. If you over-volt your RAM, you will damage the memory.<br>The Frequency, Latency and Voltages are normally printed on the side of the modules. or try visiting the manufacturer’s website for recommended settings.<br>Try running your system with one stick of RAM at a time and try each stick in different slots, going through each possible combination until you can pinpoint the cause.<br>Last but least try running Memtest86+ <a href="http://www.memtest.org/">http://www.memtest.org/</a> to determine if your problem is RAM related, rather than PSU, Hard drive etc.. Memtest86+ is a superb free utility that performs a series of tests to check memory stability. If there are any problems with your RAM or addressing RAM, then Memtest86+ will tell you.<br><br></p>
                        <h4><strong>Hard Drive Not Working</strong></h4>
                        <p>Check that your hard drive is connected correctly and securely to the Motherboard. The connections used on SATA interfaces are known to become dislodged due to transportation.<br>Try a different port or another data cable.<br>Symptoms of a failing hard drive would be, No operating system found or system no longer recognises your drive.</p>
                        <p>Strange noises, grinding noises which are potentially a disk head crashing or crackled bearings.<br>Random computer crashes and restarts.<br>The system is generally slow and unresponsive.</p>
                        <p>If you think the hard drive is failing you can go to the hard drive manufacturer website, they will have a diagnostic utility to determine drive failure. If any errors are reported, then the hard drive will be faulty.</p>
                        <p>Recovering data from a failed hard drive is unlikely, however, there are specialist companies that can recover data from failed drives but at a cost to you. Hopefully, you would keep a backup of your data.<br><br></p>
                        <h4><strong>The PC starts but then emits a series of beeps?</strong></h4>
                        <p>The series of beeps corresponds to an error code depending on the manufacture of the BIOS.</p>
                        <p>Make a note of the short-long bleeps and cross-reference them with either your Motherboard manual.<br><br>Common faults are:</p>
                        <p>RAM not inserted correctly, not working or is missing.<br>CPU Fan not attached or undetected – Make sure you have attached the CPU fan to the CPU_FAN header or adjust the<br>settings in the BIOS. If the fan is rotating less than the expected warning value, then you will get errors.<br>CPU not detected or not working. Has the CPU been installed correctly<br>Video card not inserted correctly or is not working. Make sure the card is inserted correctly and has the right power connections if applicable.<br><br></p>
                        <h4><strong>My systems supposed to be Overclocked</strong></h4>
                        <p>If you are unsure If your computer is running at its Overclocked speed the instructions below will enable you to check to see if<br>is running at the correct speed. The windows system properties will usually only read the standard CPU speed not the Overclocked speed.<br>To check that your computer is Overclocked you will need to download some programs so that this can be checked.<br>The first program that you will need to download if you haven't got this program already is CPU-Z.<br>This program will monitor all aspects of your system and will report them in a user-friendly interface.</p>
                        <p>The second program that you will need to download is a program called Prime 95. This is a stress testing tool that will put your CPU under 100% load so that the Overclock can be read accurately.</p>
