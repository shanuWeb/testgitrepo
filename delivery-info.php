                        <p>In most cases, we will have all of the components you specify in stock, but occasionally we will need to bring in a part specially for you. Once initial assembly has been completed, your system will pass to our Quality Assurance team who will check everything, complete the build and put your system through a series of strenuous tests to ensure everything is working properly. Once it has passed all of our tests, your system will be delivered to you by courier. Please do not make any special arrangements to wait in, as changes in the delivery schedule can occur. If you are not in when the courier calls, they will leave a card with a number for you to call – so you can arrange the perfect time for you. Once your system arrives, it is imperative that you check all of the parcels and contact YOYOTech immediately if you have a query. We will inform you via email when the system build passes each stage.<br><br></p>
