                                <h4>Why your University should invest in ESports</h4>
                                <p>Extracurricular activities are always encouraged as they are proven to boost student development.Research shows that students who partake in extracurricular activities are more successful in a number of ways. The most effective way to benefit from this, is for schools to offer activities that appeal to as many students as possible. Enter ESports, its well-known how common video gaming is with the younger generation. Read on for reasons ESports in schools is a great thing for students, schools, community, and all associated with the education field:</p>

                                    <h4>WORKING WITHIN A TEAM</h4>
                                    <p>Working with others requires the merging of many skills, such as communication, conflict management, active listening, and respect. These can be developed in ESports as you work within a team to achieve a goal, with rewards if the said goal is hit. Coaches and mentors of any kind are critical to student development. They help promote these behavioural standards, which then can be carried throughout their lives, whether it be work or social life.</p>

                                    <h4>PROBLEM SOLVING</h4>
                                    <p>Sports require students to set goals and assess the competition. As part of a team, students learn to form tactics and game plans in direct response to their competition. Such critical thinking is a useful skill in life.</p>

                                    <h4>TIME MANAGEMENT</h4>
                                    <p>Students have academic requirements they must meet, to remain eligible for ESports competition. This forces them to be diligent about the use of their time, akin to that of a traditional student-athlete.</p>

                                    <h4>REVENUE</h4>
                                    <p>With revenue projected to reach billions by 2020’s end, ESports can be an extremely lucrative avenue for universities, providing extra funding through sponsorships and grants. The extra money can then be used to provide quality resources for students, as well as scholarships and schemes, increasing the likelihood of their success.</p>

                                    <h4>COMMUNITY</h4>
                                    <p>Offering ESports as an extracurricular activity allows schools to reach students who would otherwise be distant from the school community. ESports can create a common-room of sorts, allowing all students to liaise in a fun, less stressful environment. By feeling a part of the community, they are more likely to be engaged during classes, graduate, and move on to higher education.</p>
